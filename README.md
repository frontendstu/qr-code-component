### What I learned

This was a very straightforward project. It was a good introduction to get the motivation flowing. Iâ€™m happy with the look of it and I think it will be very close to the original design. I may fall short with the leading of the heading and content. Probably using Sass for this project was a bit overkill, but I have been using it for many years and I just can't stop using it. I like that you can break your styles up into partials so your code looks a lot neater.
